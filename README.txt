This is the README file for my Quake IV mod.

Edits: 

1. Included level up system.  Whenever an enemy dies it grants exp to the player.

2. Whenever a player levels up the game sets health = to max healt

3. Snake Mode: Crouching lets go really fast

4. Starting Max Health is set to 500

5. Starting Max Armor is set to 500

6. Starting Armor is set to 100.


How to Play:

Kill Strogg to gain experience points. After gaining over 1000 experience points 
the player will level up.  Leveling up increases max health.  When the player
levels up it will heal to max health. 

Crouching allows you to move very quickly.  Use c to to crouch.

Controls are the same as the base game's default controls.
